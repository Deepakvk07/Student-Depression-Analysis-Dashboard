📊 Total Depression Cases: Summarizes the total count (16K+) of depression conditions in the dataset.

📁 Tools Used
Power BI – For creating dashboards and visualizing insights
Excel/CSV – As the data source for import and transformation
DAX & Power Query – For calculating sums and filtering dimensions

✅ How to Use
Open Power BI Desktop
Load the dataset from the source file (Excel or CSV)
Refresh visuals and interact with filters to explore city, degree, and gender-based depression patterns
Use the dashboard to create awareness and inform policy decisions

📌 Future Improvements
Add time-series data to track depression cases over academic years
Integrate psychological scoring metrics (like PHQ-9)
Deploy as a web dashboard for public health stakeholders
